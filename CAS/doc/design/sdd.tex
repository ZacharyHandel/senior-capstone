% What is a Software Design Document (SDD)?
%
% Software design is a process by which the software requirements are translated into a representation of software components, interfaces, and data necessary for the implementation phase. The SDD shows how the software system will be structured to satisfy the requirements. It is the primary reference for code development and, therefore, it must contain all the information required by a programmer to write code. The SDD is typically performed in two stages. The first is a preliminary design in which the overall system architecture and data architecture is defined. In the second stage -- i.e., the detailed design stage -- more detailed data structures are defined and algorithms are developed for the defined architecture.
%
% This template is an annotated outline for a software design document adapted from the IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Design Descriptions. The IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Design Descriptions have been reduced in order to simplify this assignment while still retaining the main components and providing a general idea.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Purpose}

%Identify the purpose of this SDD and its intended audience. (e.g. ``This software design document describes the architecture and system design of XX ...'').
This software design document (SDD) describes the architecture and system design for the ClassMate web application. This document will provide all design concepts and schemes created to support implementation of the application. It will also serve as a reference for stakeholders to outline requirement-supporting details. More specifically, design products include a modular system overview, architecture and a decomposition of the architecture, data design, component design, and human interface design. 


\section{Scope}

% Provide a description and scope of the software and explain the goals, objectives and benefits of your project. 
This SDD provides any supporting information for the goals, objectives, and benefits of the web application ClassMate. ClassMate provides a student-driven attendance tracking system where student's shall be able to track, view, and print their attendance for their academic courses.

ClassMate shall provide different levels of users (students, faculty, and admins) with supporting functionality to provide a smooth and efficient attendance tracking system. Students shall be able to view their assigned courses, view and print their attendance records for their assigned courses, and record their attendance for a course using a provided 6-digit code. Faculty members shall be able to bulk upload students via CSV file upload, display a 6-digit attendance code to their students, view and print attendance records, manage their courses, and manage existing attendance records for their courses. Admin shall be able to purge expired course, purge expired attendance records, create/delete/edit faculty accounts, and all other functionality that is offered to faculty members.

With a student-driven attendance tracking system, ClassMate offers more control to the student which provides less responsibility to the teacher who hold large course sizes, a more efficient attendance recording process, and a new sense of responsibility for students.

\chapter{SYSTEM OVERVIEW}
\textbf{ClassMate: Course Attendance Software} is designed to facilitate an efficient and reliable method of tracking student attendance. This web-based application addresses the logistical challenges associated with managing this task.

\section{Functionality}

At its core, ClassMate offers a role based user system, enabling distinct interactions for students, faculty, and administrators:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Students} can view and print their attendance records, track attendance in real-time using a unique code for each class session, and access historical data for all registered courses.
    \item \textbf{Faculty} have tools for managing course rosters, generating unique session codes for attendance, and overseeing student attendance records. They can upload student lists via CSV files, modify or delete entries, and generate reports on attendance data.
    \item \textbf{Administrators} are equipped with overarching control over the system, including the ability to manage user accounts (both students and faculty), delete or archive outdated courses and attendance records, and access comprehensive reports.
\end{itemize}

\section{Context}

The system operates within the educational framework of institutions ranging from small colleges to large universities. The software is meant to be flexible enough to support various academic environments. 

\section{Design}

ClassMate is developed using the Wt web toolkit, a C++ library for developing web applications. The server-side logic is implemented in C++, using Wt's comprehensive features to handle HTTP requests, generate responses, and manage session data effectively.

The client interface of ClassMate operates within any modern HTML5-compliant browser, functioning solely as a view layer without involving any HTML/CSS/JavaScript coding for logic implementation. This design ensures that the application's processing and data management are executed on the server side to avoid client-side scripting.

Security is paramount in the design of ClassMate. The application employs robust security measures to protect sensitive data, authenticate users, and manage authorization effectively. All data interactions are handled to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

\section{Background}

The motivation for developing ClassMate stems from the need for a streamlined, accurate attendance tracking system that minimizes administrative overhead and enhances the educational experience by allowing faculty to focus more on teaching and less on attendance.



\chapter{SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE}

\section{Architectural Design}

The ClassMate system employs a modular architecture designed to separate concerns, enhance maintainability, and facilitate scalability. The system is divided into four high-level subsystems, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the application:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User Interface (UI)}: Facilitates all user interactions with the system through responsive web pages. It includes modules for Login, Course Management, and Attendance Tracking.
    \item \textbf{Application Logic}: Processes data, enforces business rules, and ensures data flows correctly between the UI and the database.
    \item \textbf{Database}: Serves as the central repository for all data, including user information, course details, and attendance records. It ensures data integrity and provides efficient data retrieval.
    \item \textbf{Security Module}: Ensures the security of the system by managing authentication, authorization, and data protection.
\end{enumerate}

These subsystems interact through well-defined interfaces, allowing for clear communication and data flow between them. A diagram of this architecture is provided to illustrate a broad overview of these interactions and dependencies.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{systemdiagram.png}
    \caption{High-Level System Architecture Diagram}
    \label{fig:system_architecture}
\end{figure}

\section{Decomposition Description}

Each subsystem of the ClassMate architecture is decomposed to elaborate on its components and responsibilities:

\subsection{User Interface (UI)}
The UI is built to ensures responsiveness and accessibility. It is divided into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Login Module}: Manages user authentication.
    \item \textbf{Course Management Module}: Allows faculty and admins to create, update, and manage courses.
    \item \textbf{Attendance Tracking Module}: Enables students to enter attendance codes and faculty to track attendance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Application Logic}
This layer includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Management}: Handles operations related to user accounts.
    \item \textbf{Course Logic}: Processes course-related tasks.
    \item \textbf{Attendance Logic}: Manages the logic for recording and retrieving attendance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Database}
Structured around relational database principles, it includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Users Table}: Keeps track of all user information and roles, including credentials, profile details, and associated permissions.
    \item \textbf{Courses Table}: Stores information about courses offered, including course identifiers, names, and associated faculty.
    \item \textbf{Attendance Table}: Records attendance data for each class session, linking student IDs with course IDs, dates, and attendance status.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Module}
Incorporates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication Subsystem}: Ensures user identity verification.
    \item \textbf{Authorization Subsystem}: Controls access based on user roles.
    \item \textbf{Encryption Services}: Protects sensitive data in transit and at rest.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Rationale}

The modular architecture was chosen for its ability to isolate functional areas, making the system easier to understand, develop, and test. It allows for scalability as each module can be scaled independently. 

The current architecture, clearly defined subsystems and separation of concerns, provides a robust framework for the current and future needs of the ClassMate system.

\chapter{HUMAN INTERFACE DESIGN}

\section{Overview of User Interface}

ClassMate provides multiple features for many different users. Each user will first encounter a login page. At this page, they will be able to enter their login credentials and press a login button to fully enter the system. There will also be a "Forgot Password" button in which they will then be directed to a page to enter their email address and an email will be sent to them containing information on accessing their account. Since there are multiple users for ClassMate, after a successful login, the user will be directed to either the Student Dashboard, the Teacher Dashboard, or the Administrator Dashboard depending on the credentials used. Each dashboard will have a profile settings button that will direct the user to another page when clicked and allows them to view all of their information and edit it if needed. 

From a Student user perspective, once they enter their dashboard, they will be presented with their name and a photo ID, a list of the courses they are enrolled in/have been previously enrolled in as clickable buttons, and, like previously mentioned, a button for viewing their profile settings. If the user decides to click on a course, they will be directed to another page and presented with 2 buttons: one for viewing their attendance and one for recording their attendance. When the "View Attendance" button is clicked, they will have the option to view and print an individual attendance record for a specified day or to view and print their overall attendance record which would be for the entire semester. When the "Record Attendance" button is clicked, they will be directed to a page that allows them to enter a 6-digit code, that would be provided by the teacher, and click a submit button. If the code is valid, a success message will be displayed. If the code is invalid, an error message will appear and the entry box will be cleared, allowing them to try again.

From a Teacher user perspective, once they enter their dashboard, they will be presented with their name and a photo ID, a list of the courses they teach/have taught as clickable buttons, and, like previously mentioned, a button for viewing their profile settings. If the user decides to click on a course, they will be presented with the following buttons: one for managing the course, one for managing the attendances, and one for displaying an attendance code for the day. If they choose to click the "Display Code" button, a 6-digit code will appear for students to enter on their dashboard which will record their attendance for the day. If they choose the "Attendance Management" button, they will be presented with buttons to display an attendance record, add an attendance record, edit an attendance record, delete an attendance record, or print an overall report of attendance. If they choose the "Course Management" button, they will be presented with the following buttons: one for viewing a list of the students - which will direct them to a page with a full list of students and a button to view an individual attendance report for each student; one for modifying students - which will direct them to a page with a full list of students, a button to edit information for each student, and a button to individually delete each student; and one for on-boarding students in bulk - which will direct them to a page that will give them an option to upload a CSV file of student information, an option to send a mass email out containing a registration link, an option to display the selected file, and an option to view the guidelines of how the student information file should be formatted.

From an Admin user perspective, once they enter their dashboard, they will be presented with their name and a photo ID, a button for managing accounts, a button for managing courses, and, like previously mentioned, a button for viewing their profile settings. If the user clicks the "Manage Accounts Dashboard" button, they will be directed to a page with a list of all users in the system. They will also be presented with options for adding a student, adding a teacher, editing a user, or deleting a user. For adding a student or teacher, the user will be directed to another page in which they can choose to manually input all of the information needed or they can choose to send a registration link to the student or teacher via email. If the user clicks the "Manage Courses Dashboard" button, they will be directed to a page with a list of all courses in the system. They will also be presented with options for viewing the students in a course, assigning a teacher to a course, or deleting a course.
