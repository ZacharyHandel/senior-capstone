% which defines "shall" "should" "may" and typographic conventions
The SRS will conform to the IEEE Standards Style Manual usage for the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The word \textbf{shall} is used to indicate mandatory requirements strictly to be followed in order to conform to the requirements and from which no deviation is permitted (shall equals is required to).
\item The word \textbf{should} is used to indicate that that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others; or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required; or that (in the negative form) a certain course of action is deprecated but not prohibited (should equals is recommended that).
\item The word \textbf{may} is used to indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the requirements (may equals is permitted).
\item The words \textit{must} and \textit{will} are deprecated and shall not be used to describe mandatory requirements.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{OVERALL DESCRIPTION}

\section{Product Perspective}
% background information about the software system
% for example - what high level problem does it solve and why
The ClassMate application provides a solution to educational institutes that require attendance inside their classrooms. With educational environments that consist of large numbers of attendees, ClassMate allows for a practical and efficient solution to track related attendance. 

By moving the control of taking attendance from the teacher to the students, ClassMate empowers students to take responsibility for their attendance while providing educators with real-time insights into attendance patterns. Through a consistent user-friendly interface, students can easily confirm their presence in class using our platform.


\section{Product Features}
% a detailed list describing software features, NOT CODE
% may include example screens and reports
% may include activity or other UML diagrams
ClassMate provides numerous features and functions to support administrators, educators and students in properly tracking, managing, and evaluating attendance in the classroom.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On-boarding}: Faculty members shall have the ability to on-board students in bulk or individually. To upload in bulk, they shall be presented with a "File Upload" button where they should upload CSV files containing student information into the application. To upload individually, they shall be presented with an "Add Student" button where they should manually input the student's information. There shall also be options for editing specific student information if necessary.
    \item \textbf{Temporary Password upon Initiation}: Upon being added through our on-boarding feature, students shall receive an email containing a temporary password to allow them to set up their user account. 
    \item \textbf{Password Reset}: All users have access to our account credentials recovery system where they are able to reset their password. At the initial login page, there is a "Forgot Password" option that shall direct the user to another page where they should enter their email and a temporary access code shall then be sent to them in an email which ensures the correct person is changing the password. After submitting their email, a new page shall open for them to enter the temporary code. The user should then enter a new password and confirm that password. 
    \item \textbf{Student-Centered Attendance}: Our application allows for students to be responsible for tracking their attendance in the classroom. Upon entering the classroom, an educator shall have the ability to display the 6-digit code provided to them for their classroom. Students should use the application to enter the provided code thus recording their attendance for the day. 
    \item \textbf{Student Information Access}: When students enter their account, they shall have options to view their profile settings, track their attendance, and view their attendances. For viewing their attendances, they shall have the option to see their attendance for different classes and choose the time period for which they want to look at (day or term).
    \item \textbf{Attendance Evaluation}: Faculty members shall have the ability to evaluate attendance reports on multiple levels.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Print Classroom Attendance Reports: Faculty members have the option to print classroom attendance reports for a specific day as well as an attendance report for the entire term. 
        \item Print Individual Attendance Reports: Faculty members have the option to print an attendance record for a specific student in their classroom for either a specific day or for the term.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classroom Management}: Faculty members shall have the ability to add, edit, or delete students as well as attendance records in a classroom.
    \item \textbf{Admin Management}: Administrators shall have the ability to create, edit, or delete faculty accounts, student accounts, and courses.  
\end{itemize}

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
% use cases and usage scenarios - NOT OOP CLASSES
It is important for us to outline our application's use cases to outline the intentions of our application towards our users. A use case in this context will capture the interactions that occur between our users and our application for a specific goal. The structure of these uses cases will include required functions, the actors, and possible actions. To see the created use case diagrams, reference figures \ref{fig:SRA}, \ref{fig:LIP-RAC}, or \ref{fig:VACS-EFA}.

\subsection{Actors}
It is important to understand the list of actors for ClassMate. According to Roger Pressman (2019, p.131). An actor can be defined as "an entity that interacts with a system object."  Below is a list of all applicable actors for ClassMate:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Client and Server:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Client}
            \begin{itemize} 
                \item Web Browser Compatibility: The client-side of components of the software operate in the supporting web browsers environments: Google Chrome.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textit{Server}
            \begin{itemize}  
                \item Database Management System: The server interacts with a database management system such as [ENTER DATABASE SYSTEM (MySQL ...)] to manage and store attendance logs and student information. 
                \item Email: The ClassMate software relies on email communication to send notifications and password reset instructions to users. A SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server is required for sending emails to users. The system will use an external SMTP server for sending emails. The administrator is responsible for configuring the SMTP server settings in the software's configuration. 
                \item Multi-user Support: The system supports multiple users concurrently ensuring that the faculty, students, and administrators will be able to interact with the system concurrently.
                \item Network Connectivity: The server hosting the software must have a reliable internet connection to allow user to access the software from different locations. Students, faculty, and administrators will be required to have stable internet connectivity to access the ClassMate web-based interface.
                \item Operating System: The server operating system chosen for ClassMate is OpenBSD for its strong reliability and security.
                \item Server Specifications: The server runs on a 64-bit Intel/AMD architecture, ensuring compatibility with modern hardware. The software requires [XX GB] of disk space for data storage, depending on the storage used to store the information about students and attendance logs. [XX GB] of RAM is recommended for optimal performance.  
            \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Programming language:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{C++}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The ClassMate is implemented using C++ due to several key advantages that align with the software's requirements and the familiarity of the developments team with the language. C++ is known for its performance and efficiency in handling large volumes of data and concurrent user requests. Along with performance, various tools offered in C++ simplify the development process and reduce effort.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Specific libraries/technology:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{Libraries}
                    \begin{itemize}
